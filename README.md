youtube-disable-autoplay
============

Tired of your YouTube tabs screaming at you when you restart your browser? With this user script, only videos that you can actually see start playing automatically. Those that you open in a hidden tab get paused, so you can watch them when you actually want to. Currently only tested on Chrome, and doesn't work on videos with ads.
